## Purpose
This is my first attempt using D3.JS to build data visualization. By Using D3.JS, I was able to build
- X-axis and Y-axis
- Using scaleLinear to build the range of the axis
- Showing circles as scatter plot
- Showing tooltips for each circle
- Using Max() and Min() to automatically pick the largest number for each axis.
You are able to see the final result through: https://harpskye.github.io/Scatter_Plot_D3JS/

## Next Step
- Alway more charts!
- Build css effects
- Build event listeners and mouse events.
- More interactice and better UI/UX.
